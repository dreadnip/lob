#Lob

This is a HTML snapshot of http://lobste.rs that I'm using to refactor their HTML structure and CSS with the goal of creating a:
* More modern and stable
* More accessible
* More readable
* More usable

website; with *as little visual changes as possible*.

Ideally I'd work straight onto a fork of their main repo bur I'm not a Ruby dev and I didn't want to set up an entire Ruby dev env for this purpose.

You can see my rework live in action over at the Github Page for this site: https://dreadnip.github.io/lob/
